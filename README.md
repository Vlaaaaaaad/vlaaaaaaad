### Hi there 👋

I'm Vlad (**he/him**), a "_Professional mistake avoider_", more commonly known as _Consultant_ or _Strategic Advisor_.

### 💼 Work

I'm focused on getting companies to the high-performing levels. I work on AWS, with Serverless and Containers. I have an intense focus on observability and developer experience, and I spend most of my time lifting people up.

- My outdated ["_Scaling containers on AWS_" blog post](https://www.vladionescu.me/posts/scaling-containers-in-aws/) which is superseded by [my re:Invent 2020 talk, "_Scaling containers on AWS_", available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhRiLCxYNbo)
- My ["_Fixing EKS DNS_" blog post](https://www.vladionescu.me/posts/eks-dns/) shined a light on NodeLocalDNS, making running Kubernetes clusters at scale way easier. Due to the incredible k8s community, most of this was merged in the upstream documentation 💕
- If you a glimpse into how much of a golden retriever I am, check out my ["_Accidentally a hacker_" blog post](https://www.vladionescu.me/posts/how-i-became-a-hacker/) which tells the story of how my passion and energy was combined with alcool and led to accidentally hacking GitHub
